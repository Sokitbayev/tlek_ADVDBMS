# Online Library

The idea of our project is to perform better experience in book readings. In order to see how it will look like, we're gonna use datasets from Kaggle.com. Site will contain eBooks, press articles and audio books. In the period of pandemy many online servies appeared, and this one is another variation of them. We will try to combaine all pros that we know and take into account cons of other applications and servies. For now, the main part of it is to make online library, and then, maybe, we will add few more features like :

  - physical inventory system
  - account system
  - rating system
  - many other useful features
